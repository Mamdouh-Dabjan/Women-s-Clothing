# Women'sClothing
I summarized data about Women's clothing in order to determine the target audience and which ones are the most successful
The data is from Kaggle https://bit.ly/3A5bOrL
The link to the final dashboard https://tabsoft.co/3c3pn2Y
The files are the dataset and the summarized version of the dataset
Steps taken to do this Project:
1- upload the data to databricks in order to clean, filter, and summarize it.
2- create a worksheet that has the cleaned version in it
3- create a viz using tablaeu
